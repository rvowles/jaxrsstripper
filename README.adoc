== JAXRS API Stripper

This application allows you to strip the APIs from a JAXRS application that
has mixed implementation and api definition.

JAXRS APIs should be defined in interfaces and then implemented. Its important to have them
as separate artifacts so downstream dependencies can be explicit and force builds, and be obvious.
It also allows easy mocking, easy direct injection in Jersey 2 (because of the client proxy) and
overall significantly less code and maintenance.

This application will take your existing packages of Java classes that mix implementation and interface
and pull the interfaces out. It will then remove those annotations from your implementation classes.

Its not perfect, it doesn't:

- exclude imports that aren't used, IntelliJ can do this easily
- include dto style classes that are being needed. This again should be pretty easy to move, and dtos if being used
 should use my other dto plugin (dtogen)
